# Water-potability-prediction
project is to develop a model that can predict whether water is potable or non-potable,This involves creating a binary classification system where the model will output either "1" for potable water or "0" for non-potable water. The input data will consist of features such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity etc .
